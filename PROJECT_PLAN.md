# Nested To-Do App - CS50 Final Project

A minimalist web-based task manager that allows infinite nesting of tasks. Users can break down large goals into smaller subtasks recursively, creating a hierarchical structure ideal for project planning. Most task apps stop at one or two levels of nesting. This project allows **infinite recursion** — a task may contain a subtask, which itself can contain other subtasks, and so on.

This structure makes it ideal for programmers, writers, and planners who break problems into smaller atomic units.


## Technologies:

Backend: Python (Flask)
Database: SQLite
Frontend: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap 5), JavaScript (Vanilla ES6)
No external libraries beyond Bootstrap (removed SortableJS, no drag-drop)

## Core Features (Only These!)
✅ 1. Basic Task Management

Add a new task
View all tasks in a list
Mark task as complete/incomplete (checkbox)
Delete a task (with recursive deletion of all subtasks)

✅ 2. Infinite Nesting (Your Unique Feature)

Add subtasks to any existing task
Display hierarchical structure with visual indentation
Recursive rendering: parent → child → grandchild → infinite depth
Visual connector lines showing parent-child relationships

✅ 3. Task Details Panel

Click any task to view full details
Edit task title (inline or in detail pane)
Edit task description (textarea with auto-save)
View immediate child tasks of selected task

✅ 4. Database

SQLite with simple schema
Parent-child relationship via parent_id foreign key
Basic CRUD operations

✅ 5. Clean Web Interface

Three-pane layout: Sidebar | Task List | Detail Pane
Responsive design (stacks on mobile)
Bootstrap 5 for clean styling
No modals or popups - everything inline

## Backend API Endpoints

Backend API Endpoints (Minimal)
EndpointMethodDescription/GETMain interface/api/tasksGETGet all top-level tasks with children/api/task/<id>GETGet single task with details/api/task/addPOSTAdd new task (with optional parent_id)/api/task/<id>/updatePOSTUpdate title or description/api/task/<id>/togglePOSTToggle done/undone/api/task/<id>/deletePOSTDelete task and all subtasks

Removed endpoints:

❌ /api/list/<name> (no categories/filters)
❌ /api/task/reorder (no drag-drop)

## **Component Breakdown**

### **1. Flask Application (`app.py`)**

| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `init_db()`                 | Creates and initializes the `tasks` table schema in SQLite.             |
| `get_db_connection()`       | Opens a persistent SQLite connection.                                   |

## **Client-Side Logic (JavaScript)**

| Function                | Description                                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `selectTask(id)`        | Fetches and loads task details + subtasks in the detail pane.  |
| `toggleDone(id)`        | Toggles `is_done` flag for the given task via API.             |
| `saveTitle(id)`         | Saves inline-edited title on blur or Enter key.                |
| `promptAddSubtask(id)`  | Prompts for new subtask title and adds it.                     |
| `deleteTask(id)`        | Sends soft-delete request, then shows undo toast.              |
| `addToMyDay(id)`        | Marks task as part of “My Day” and updates counter.            |
| `toggleCollapse(id)`    | Expands/collapses subtasks and stores state in `localStorage`. |
| `submitAddForm()`       | Adds new top-level task from the main input.                   |
| `autosaveDescription()` | Auto-saves description changes with 1s debounce.               |
| `renderTaskList()`      | Dynamically re-renders visible tasks (or reloads for now).     |
| `updateMyDayCount()`    | Refreshes “My Day” badge count.                                |
| `enableInlineEdit(id)`  | Activates in-place title editing on double-click.              |
| `showToast(msg)`        | Creates lightweight Bootstrap toast for feedback.              |
| `Sortable.onEnd()`      | Updates task positions and parent after drag-and-drop.         |

---

## **User Interface Behavior**

### **Sidebar**

* Collapsible (stays at 68px when collapsed).
* Displays smart lists and user categories.
* Each list loads tasks dynamically via `/api/list/<name>` endpoint.

### **Task List**

* Displays recursive nested structure with visual connectors.
* Hovering over a task reveals:

  * “Add Subtask” button.
  * “Add to My Day” star.
  * “Delete” button.
* Drag handle for reordering tasks (`fa-grip-vertical` icon).
* Collapsible subtasks to prevent clutter.

### **Detail Pane**

* Shows the selected task’s title, description, and progress bar.
* Auto-saves edits to description after 1 second of pause.
* Displays immediate subtasks for quick access.
* Updates instantly when a new subtask is selected.

---

## **UX Flow**

1. **Add a task** → Appears in Inbox by default.
2. **Add subtasks** → Click + icon next to parent task.
3. **Collapse or expand** → Click chevron next to parent task.
4. **Mark complete** → Check the checkbox; parent progress updates.
5. **Add to My Day** → Click the star button; resets automatically at midnight.
6. **Delete** → Soft delete, undo available for 30 seconds.
7. **Reorder** → Drag by grip handle; position saved automatically.
8. **Edit details** → Click on title or description; auto-save handles persistence.

---

## **Auto Reset: “My Day”**

* Runs in a **background daemon thread**.
* Checks system time every 60 seconds.
* At midnight, executes:

  ```sql
  UPDATE tasks SET is_today = 0 WHERE is_today = 1;
  ```
* Resets the “My Day” view automatically.

---

## **Responsive Design Behavior**

| Screen Width | Layout                                          |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **> 900px**  | 3-column layout (Sidebar + Tasks + Detail Pane) |
| **< 900px**  | Sidebar hidden, task list occupies full width   |
| **< 600px**  | Task detail view stacks vertically under list   |
| **Mobile**   | Floating add button, collapsible list sections  |

---

## **Accessibility Features**

* `aria-label` for all icons and buttons.
* Keyboard support for:

  * `Enter` to confirm edits.
  * `Esc` to cancel inline edit.
  * Arrow keys to navigate tasks.
* High contrast text and visible focus outlines.
* Screen-reader friendly roles:

  * `role="list"` for UL elements.
  * `role="listitem"` for LI elements.

## **Possible Future Extensions**

| Category                  | Ideas                                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Reminders & Due Dates** | Add date pickers and notification logic.        |
| **Recurring Tasks**       | Allow tasks to repeat daily/weekly/monthly.     |
| **Collaboration**         | Add user authentication and shared lists.       |
| **Attachments**           | Upload and link files or images to tasks.       |
| **Search & Filters**      | Full-text search and task filtering.            |
| **Notifications**         | Browser push notifications for due tasks.       |
| **Markdown Support**      | Render formatted task descriptions.             |
| **Dark Mode**             | Toggle between light and dark Bootstrap themes. |

---

## **Design Philosophy**

1. **Minimal clicks.** Everything should be editable in place.
2. **Visual clarity.** Indentation and lines show hierarchy instantly.
3. **Performance simplicity.** Flat SQLite DB + recursion for hierarchy.
4. **Automatic behavior.** Auto-save, auto-reset, and auto-refresh minimize friction.
5. **Extensibility.** Every feature (categories, reminders, markdown) can plug into the same schema.

## **Final Notes**

This project was built to emphasize **nested thinking** and **frictionless flow** — every part of the design, from the connector lines to auto-save and midnight reset, was made to keep users thinking *about their tasks*, not the interface.

The structure and modular backend allow easy evolution into a full productivity platform with reminders, collaboration, and AI insights.

Would you like me to generate a version of this README with **GitHub-flavored Markdown formatting** (links, tables, collapsible sections, icons) and **proper CS50 submission tone (academic but concise)** next? It’ll be plug-and-play for your repo and submission form.
